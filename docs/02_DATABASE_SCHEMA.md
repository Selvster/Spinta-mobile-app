Statistics Tables (aggregated):
- club_season_statistics (from match_statistics)
- player_season_statistics (from player_match_statistics)
- player_match_statistics (from events)

Key relationships:
- users.user_id → coaches.user_id (1:1, always linked)
- users.user_id → players.user_id (1:1, NULL before signup, linked after)
- coaches.coach_id → clubs.coach_id (1:1)

- Used to calculate player and match statistics
- Links to players via `statsbomb_player_id`

**JSONB Query Examples (Efficient Use of GIN Index):**

```sql
-- ✓ GOOD: Uses GIN index efficiently (containment operator @>)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data @> '{"type": {"name": "Shot"}}'::jsonb;

SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data @> '{"shot": {"outcome": {"name": "Goal"}}}'::jsonb;

-- ✓ GOOD: Uses existence operator (?)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data->'pass' ? 'goal_assist';

-- ✓ GOOD: Combined containment checks
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data @> '{"type": {"name": "Pass"}}'::jsonb
  AND event_data->'pass' ? 'goal_assist';

-- ✗ BAD: Full table scan (doesn't use GIN index properly)
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data->>'type' = 'Shot';

SELECT * FROM events
WHERE event_data->'shot'->'outcome'->>'name' = 'Goal';

-- Extract nested values efficiently (use after filtering with @>)
SELECT
  event_data->>'player_name' as player,
  (event_data->'shot'->>'statsbomb_xg')::numeric as xg
FROM events
WHERE event_data @> '{"type": {"name": "Shot"}}'::jsonb
  AND event_data @> '{"shot": {"outcome": {"name": "Goal"}}}'::jsonb;

## Sample Data Flow

### Creating a Player (Admin Match Processing)

```sql
-- 1. Insert incomplete player
INSERT INTO players (
  player_id,
  club_id,
  player_name,
  statsbomb_player_id,
  jersey_number,
  position,
  invite_code,
  is_linked,
  created_at,
  updated_at
) VALUES (
  'uuid-here',
  'club-uuid',
  'Marcus Silva',
  5470,
  10,
  'Forward',
  'MRC-1827',
  FALSE,
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

### Player Signup

```sql
-- 1. Validate invite code
SELECT * FROM players
WHERE invite_code = 'MRC-1827' AND is_linked = FALSE;

-- 2. Create user account (using player_id from step 1)
INSERT INTO users (
  user_id,        -- Same as player_id!
  email,
  password_hash,
  full_name,
  user_type,
  created_at,
  updated_at
) VALUES (
  'player-uuid',
  'marcus@email.com',
  'hashed_password',
  'Marcus Silva',
  'player',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);

-- 3. Update player record
UPDATE players SET
  player_name = 'Marcus Silva',  -- Can be different if player changed it
  birth_date = '2008-03-20',
  height = 180,
  profile_image_url = 'https://...',
  is_linked = TRUE,
  linked_at = NOW(),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE player_id = 'player-uuid';
```

### Training Progress

```sql
-- 1. Player completes exercise
UPDATE training_exercises SET
  completed = TRUE,
  completed_at = NOW()
WHERE exercise_id = 'exercise-uuid';

-- 2. Check if plan should update status
SELECT
  plan_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_exercises,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN completed THEN 1 END) as completed_exercises
FROM training_exercises
WHERE plan_id = 'plan-uuid'
GROUP BY plan_id;

-- 3. Update plan status if needed
UPDATE training_plans SET
  status = CASE
    WHEN (completed_exercises = total_exercises) THEN 'completed'
    WHEN (completed_exercises > 0) THEN 'in_progress'
    ELSE 'pending'
  END
WHERE plan_id = 'plan-uuid';
```

## Notes for Implementation

1. **UUID Generation**: Use PostgreSQL's `gen_random_uuid()` or generate in application code

2. **Timestamps**: Use `NOW()` or application-level timestamp generation

3. **Invite Code Generation**: Use cryptographically secure random (e.g., Python's `secrets` module)

4. **Password Hashing**: Use bcrypt with cost factor 12

5. **Statistics Calculation**: Triggered after match processing, aggregated from events table

6. **Attributes Calculation**: Calculated from season statistics using proprietary formulas

7. **Player Name Sync**: When player updates name, update both `players.player_name` and `users.full_name`

8. **Training Status**: Automatically updated when exercises are marked complete/incomplete
