# Player Endpoints

## Overview

This document details all API endpoints for the player-facing features of the Spinta platform. All endpoints require authentication with a valid JWT token and `user_type = "player"`.

The player mobile app uses a bottom navigation bar with 4 tabs:

- **My Stats**: Player's attributes and season statistics
- **Matches**: List and details of all matches
- **Training**: List and details of training plans
- **Profile**: Player profile information

## Authentication

All endpoints require:

- **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`
- **Token payload:** `user_type = "player"`

## Navigation Structure

Unlike the coach view which uses top tabs within screens, the player view uses a bottom navigation bar to switch between main sections. Each section may have its own internal tabs.

---

## 1. My Stats Tab (Player Dashboard)

**UI Reference:** Page 25 in Spinta UI.pdf

**UI Purpose:** Display player's attributes (radar chart) and season statistics organized by categories.

### GET /api/player/dashboard

**Total: 7 endpoints**

### Authorization Rules

1. **Player-only access:** All endpoints require `user_type = "player"` in JWT token
2. **Resource ownership:** Players can only access their own data:
   - Matches must include the player
   - Training plans must be assigned to the player
   - Profile is their own
3. **Validation on every request:** Backend must verify player_id from JWT matches resource ownership

### Key Features

1. **Bottom Navigation Structure:**

   - My Stats: Attributes and season statistics by categories
   - Matches: List and detail views with 3 internal tabs
   - Training: List and detail views with checkboxes
   - Profile: Personal information and club details

2. **Statistics Categories:**

   - GENERAL: Matches played
   - ATTACKING: Goals, assists, xG, shots
   - PASSING: Total passes, accuracy, key passes, crosses
   - DRIBBLING: Total dribbles, success rate
   - DEFENDING: Tackles, interceptions, success rates

3. **Training Progress:**

   - Automatic status updates based on exercise completion
   - Progress percentage calculated in real-time
   - Players can toggle exercises on/off with checkboxes

4. **Match Detail Format:**
   - Simple page showing match header, player summary (goals/assists), and categorized statistics
   - Identical structure to coach's view of player match detail (Page 15)

### Key Differences from Coach View

1. **Navigation:** Bottom nav bar instead of top tabs within screens
2. **No AI Generation:** Players cannot create training plans (no "Create Training Plan Using AI" button)
3. **Checkbox Toggles:** Players can check/uncheck exercises to mark completion
4. **Simplified Dashboard:** Only "My Stats" content (no mixed content like club info or recent matches)
