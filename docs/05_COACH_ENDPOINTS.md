# Coach Endpoints

## Overview

This document details all API endpoints for the coach-facing features of the Spinta platform. All endpoints require authentication with a valid JWT token and `user_type = "coach"`.

## Authentication

All endpoints require:

- **Header:** `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`
- **Token payload:** `user_type = "coach"`

For detailed authentication flow and endpoints, see `04_AUTHENTICATION.md` and `03_PLAYER_SIGNUP_FLOW.md`.

## Database Query Parameters

All database queries in this document use named parameters prefixed with `:`. This section explains how each parameter is derived.

### Parameters Derived from JWT Token

**Direct JWT Parameters** (extracted directly from JWT payload):
- `:user_id_from_jwt` - The `user_id` field from the JWT token payload

**Indirect JWT Parameters** (derived from JWT via database lookups):
- `:club_id_from_jwt` - Club ID for the authenticated coach
  - **Derivation:** JWT `user_id` → `coaches.user_id` → `clubs.coach_id` → `clubs.club_id`
  - **SQL:** `SELECT c.club_id FROM users u JOIN coaches co ON u.user_id = co.user_id JOIN clubs c ON co.coach_id = c.coach_id WHERE u.user_id = :user_id_from_jwt`

- `:coach_id_from_jwt` - Coach ID for the authenticated user
  - **Derivation:** JWT `user_id` → `coaches.user_id` → `coaches.coach_id`
  - **SQL:** `SELECT coach_id FROM coaches WHERE user_id = :user_id_from_jwt`

### Parameters from API Requests

**Path Parameters** (from URL):
- `:match_id` - Match UUID from `/api/coach/matches/{match_id}`
- `:player_id` - Player UUID from `/api/coach/players/{player_id}`
- `:plan_id` - Training plan UUID from `/api/coach/training-plans/{plan_id}`

**Query Parameters** (from URL query string):
- `:matches_limit` - Pagination limit for matches list
- `:matches_offset` - Pagination offset for matches list

**Body Parameters** (from JSON request body):
- `:plan_name`, `:duration`, `:coach_notes` - Training plan fields
- Various exercise fields - Training exercise data

### Authorization Pattern

All endpoints follow this authorization pattern:
1. Extract `:user_id_from_jwt` from JWT token
2. Derive `:club_id_from_jwt` or `:coach_id_from_jwt` via database lookup
3. Validate that requested resources (matches, players, training plans) belong to the coach's club
4. Return 403 Forbidden if authorization check fails

## Endpoints Organized by UI Screens

**Note:** Lineups are populated from Starting XI events during match processing. Backend splits results by `team_type` to populate `our_team` and `opponent_team` arrays.

**Error Responses:**

Not Found (404):

```json

  "detail": "Match not found."
}
```

Forbidden (403):

```json
{
  "detail": "This match does not belong to your club."
